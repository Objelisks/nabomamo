Both wolves and wraiths were fairly common monsters in Arena, and you  could encounter plenty of these in Elden Grove.</p>

<h4>Dramatis Personae</h4>

<li>Malvasian: A High Elf battlemage</li>
<li>Inzoliah: A Dark Elf battlemage</li>
<li>Dolcettus: A Cyrodiil healer</li>
<li>Schiavas: An Argonian barbarian</li>
<li>A Ghost</li>

</ul>
<p class="it">Scene: Eldenwood</p>
<p class="it">As the curtain rises, we see the misty labyrinthian landscape of the  legendary Eldengrove of Valenwood. All around we hear wolves howling. A  bloodied reptilian figure, <b>SCHIAVAS</b>, breaks through the branches  of one of the trees and surveys the area.</p>
<p><b>SCHIAVAS:</b> It's clear.</p>
<p class="it"><b>INZOLIAH</b>, a beautiful Dark Elf mage, climbs down from the tree,  helped by the barbarian. There is the sound of footsteps nearby.  Schiavas readies his sword and Inzoliah prepares to cast a spell.  Nothing comes out.</p>
<p><b>INZOLIAH:</b> You're bleeding. You should have Dolcettus heal that  for you.</p>
<p><b>SCHIAVAS:</b> He's still drained from all the spells he had to cast  down in the caves. I'm fine. If we get out of this and no one needs it  more, I'll take the last potion of healing. Where's Malvasian?</p>
<p><i> <b>MALVASIAN</b>, a High Elf battlemage, and <b>DOLCETTUS</b>, a  Cyrodiil healer, emerge from the tree, carrying a heavy chest between  the two of them. They awkwardly try to get down from the tree, carrying  their loot.  </i></p>
<p><b>MALVASIAN:</b> Here I am, though why I'm carrying the heavy load is  beyond me. I always thought that the advantage of dungeon delving with a  great barbarian was that he carried all the loot.</p>
<p><b>SCHIAVAS:</b> If I carried that, my hands would be too full to fight.  And tell me if I'm wrong, but not one of the three of you has enough  magicka reserved to make it out of here alive. Not after you electrified  and blasted all those homunculuses down below ground.</p>
<p><b>DOLCETTUS:</b> Homunculi.</p>
<p><b>SCHIAVAS:</b> Don't worry, I'm not going to do what you think I'm  going to do.</p>
<p><b>INZOLIAH</b> (innocently): What's that?</p>
<p><b>SCHIAVAS:</b> Kill you all and take the Ebony Mail for myself. Admit  it -- you thought I had that in mind.</p>
<p><b>DOLCETTUS:</b> What a perfectly horrible thought. I never thought  anyone, no matter how vile and degenerate --</p>
<p><b>INZOLIAH:</b> Why not?</p>
<p><b>MALVASIAN:</b> He needs porters, like he said. He can't carry the  chest and fight off the inhabitants of Eldengrove both.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>DOLCETTUS:</b> By Stendarr, of all the mean, conniving, typically  Argonian --</p>
<p><b>INZOLIAH:</b> And why do you need me alive?</p>
<p><b>SCHIAVAS:</b> I don't necessarily. Except that you're prettier than  the other two, for a smoothskin that is. And if something comes after  us, it might go for you first.</p>
<p class="it">There is a noise in some bushes nearby.</p>
<p><b>SCHIAVAS:</b> Go check that out.</p>
<p><b>INZOLIAH:</b> It's probably a wolf. These woods are filled with them.  You check it out.</p>
<p><b>SCHIAVAS:</b> You have a choice, Inzoliah. Go and you might live.  Stay here, and you definitely won't.</p>
<p class="it">Inzoliah considers and then goes to the bushes.</p>
<p><b>SCHIAVAS <i>(to Malvasian and Dolcettus)</i>:</b> The king of  Silvenar will pay good money for the Mail, and we can divide it more  nicely between three than four.</p>
<p><b>INZOLIAH:</b> You're so right.</p>
<p class="it">Inzoliah suddenly levitates up to the top of the stage. A  semi-transparent Ghost appears from the bush and rushes at the next  person, who happens to be Schiavas. As the barbarian screams and  thrashes at it with his sword, it levels blasts of whirling gas at him.  He crumbles to the ground. It turns next to Dolcettus, the healer, and  as the Ghost focuses its feasting chill on the hapless Dolcettus,  Malvasian casts a ball of flame at it that causes it to vaporize into  the misty air.</p>
<p class="it">Inzoliah floats back down to the ground as Malvasian examines the bodies  of Dolcettus and Schiavas, who are both white-faced from the draining  power of the ghost.</p>
<p><b>MALVASIAN:</b> You had some magicka reserved after all.</p>
<p><b>INZOLIAH:</b> So did you. Are they dead?</p>
<p class="it">Malvasian takes the potion of healing from Dolcettus's pack.</p>
<p><b>MALVASIAN:</b> Yes. Fortunately, the potion of healing wasn't broken  when he fell. Well, I guess this leaves just the two of us to collect  the reward.</p>
<p><b>INZOLIAH:</b> We can't get out of this place without each other. Like  it or not.</p>
<p class="it">The two battlemages pick up the chest and begin plodding carefully  through the undergrowth, pausing from time to time at the sound of  footsteps or other eerie noises.</p>
<p><b>MALVASIAN:</b> Let me make sure I understand. You have a little bit  of magicka left, so you elected to use it to make Schiavas the ghost's  target, forcing me to use most of my limited reserve to destroy the  creature so I wouldn't be more powerful than you. That's first-rate  thinking.</p>
<p><b>INZOLIAH:</b> Thank you. It's only logical. Do you have enough power  to cast any other spells?</p>
<p><b>MALVASIAN:</b> Naturally. An experienced battlemage always knows a  few minor but highly effective spells for just such a trial. I take it  you, too, have a few tricks up your sleeve?</p>
<p><b>INZOLIAH:</b> Of course, like you said.</p>
<p class="it">They pause for a moment before continuing as a fearful wail pierces the  air. When it dies away, they slowly trudge on.</p>
<p><b>INZOLIAH:</b> Just as an intellectual exercise, I wonder what spell  you would cast at me if we made it out of here without any more combat.</p>
<p><b>MALVASIAN:</b> I hope you're not implying that I would dream of  killing you so I would keep the treasure all to myself.</p>
<p><b>INZOLIAH:</b> Of course not, nor would I do that to you. It is merely  an intellectual exercise.</p>
<p><b>MALVASIAN:</b> Well, in that case, purely as an intellectual  exercise, I would probably cast a leech spell on you, to take away your  life force and heal myself. After all, there are brigands on the road  between here and Silvenar, and a wounded battlemage with a valuable  artifact would make a tempting target. I'd hate to survive Eldengrove  merely to die in the open.</p>
<p><b>INZOLIAH:</b> That's a well-reasoned response. As for myself, again,  not saying I would ever do this, but I think a simple, sudden electrical  bolt would serve my purposes admirably. I agree about the danger of  brigands, but don't forget, we also have a potion of healing. I could  easily slay you and heal myself to full capacity.</p>
<p><b>MALVASIAN:</b> Very true. It would end up a question then of whose  spell was more effective at that instant. If our spells counteracted one  another and I leeched your life energy only to be crippled by your  lightning bolt, then we could both be killed. Or so near death that a  mere potion of healing would scarcely help either one of us, let alone  both. How ironic it would be if two scheming battlemages, not saying we  are scheming but for the purpose of this intellectual exercise, were  left on the brink of death, completely drained of magicka, with one  healing potion to choose from. Who would get it then?</p>
<p><b>INZOLIAH:</b> Logically, whoever drank it first, which in this case  would be you since you're holding it. Now, what if one of us were  injured, but not killed?</p>
<p><b>MALVASIAN:</b> Logic would dictate that a scheming battlemage would  take the potion, leaving the injured party to the mercy of the elements,  I suppose.</p>
<p><b>INZOLIAH:</b> That does seem most sensible. But suppose that the  battlemages, while certainly scheming types, had a certain respect for  one another. Perhaps in that case, the victorious one might, for  instance, put the potion up a tree near his or her gravely wounded  victim. Then when the wounded party had enough magicka replenished, he  or she would be able to levitate to the tree branches and recover the  potion. By that time, the victorious battlemage would have already  collected the reward.</p>
<p class="it">They pause for a moment at the sound of something in the bushes nearby.  Carefully, they climb across the branches of a tree to bypass it.</p>
<p><b>MALVASIAN:</b> I understand what you're saying, but it seems out of  character for our hypothetic scheming battlemage to allow his or her  victim to live.</p>
<p><b>INZOLIAH:</b> Perhaps. But it's been my observation that most  scheming battlemages enjoy the feeling of having bested someone in  combat, and having that person alive to live with the humiliation.</p>
<p><b>MALVASIAN:</b> These hypothetical scheming battlemages sound ...  (excitedly) Daylight! Do you see it?</p>
<p class="it">The two scurry across the branch dropping behind a bush, so we can no  longer see them. We can, however, see the shimmering halo of sunlight.</p>
<p><b>MALVASIAN <i>(behind the tall bush)</i>:</b> We made it.</p>
<p><b>INZOLIAH <i>(likewise, behind the tall bush)</i>:</b> Indeed.</p>
<p class="it">There is a sudden explosion of electrical energy and a wild howling aura  of red light, and then silence. After a few moment's pause, we hear  someone climbing up the tree. It is Malvasian, putting the potion high  up in the bough. He chuckles as he climbs back down and the curtain  drops.</p>
<h3>Epilogue.</h3>
<p class="it">The curtain rises on a road to Silvenar. A gang of bandits have  surrounded Malvasian, who is propped up on his staff, barely able to  stand. They pull his chest away from him with ease.</p>
<p><b>BANDIT #1:</b> What have we got here? Don't you know it ain't safe to  be out on the road, all sick like you are? Why don't we help you with  your load?</p>
<p><b>MALVASIAN <i>(weakly)</i>:</b> Please ... Let me be ...</p>
<p><b>BANDIT #2:</b> Go on, spellcaster, fight us for it!</p>
<p><b>MALVASIAN:</b> I can't ... too weak ...</p>
<p class="it">Suddenly, Inzoliah flies in, casting lightning bolts from her fingers at  the bandits, who quickly scramble away. She lands on the ground and  picks up the chest. Malvasian collapses, dying.</p>
<p><b>MALVASIAN:</b> Hypothetically, what if ... a battlemage cast a spell  on another which didn't harm him at once, but ... drained his life force  and his magicka, bit by bit, so he wouldn't know at the time, but ...  feel confident enough to leave the potion of healing behind?</p>
<p><b>INZOLIAH:</b> A most treacherous battlemage she'd be.</p>
<p><b>MALVASIAN:</b> And ... hypothetically ... would she be likely to help  her fallen foe ... so that she could enjoy the humiliation of him  continuing ... to live?</p>
<p><b>INZOLIAH:</b> From my experience, hypothetically, no. She doesn't  sound like a fool.</p>
<p class="it">As Inzoliah lugs the chest off toward Silvenar, and Malvasian expires on  the stage, we drop the curtain.</p>

<p>Listed below are some of the more storied items found throughout  Tamrielic lore. The existence of some has been proven, while others may  simply be the stuff of legend. Regardless, these items have found their  way into the tales we tell our children, and our children will tell  their children, and are inextricably linked to the</p>
<h3>Lord's Mail</h3>
<p>Sometimes called the Armor of Morihaus or the gift of Kynareth, this is  an ancient cuirass of unsurpassable quality. It grants the wearer power  to absorb health, resist the effects of spells, and cure oneself of  poison when used. It is said that whenever Kynareth deigns the wearer  unworthy, the Lord's Mail will be taken away and hidden for the next  chosen one.</p>
<h3>Ebony Mail</h3>
<p>The Ebony Mail is a breastplate created before recorded history by the  Dark Elven goddess Boethiah. It is she who determines who should possess  the Ebony Mail and for how long a time. If judged worthy, its power  grants the wearer added resistance of fire, magicka, and grants a  magical shield. It is Boethiah alone who determines when a person is  ineligible to bear the Ebony Mail any longer, and the goddess can be  very capricious.</p>
<h3>Spell Breaker</h3>
<p>Spell Breaker, superficially a Dwemer tower shield, is one of the most  ancient relics of Tamriel. Aside from its historical importance in the  Battle of Rourken-Shalidor, the Spell Breaker protects its wielder  almost completely from any spell caster, either by reflecting magicks or  silencing any mage about to cast a spell. It is said that Spell Breaker  still searches for its original owner, and will not remain the property  of anyone else for long. For most, possessing Spell Breaker for any  length of time is power enough.</p>
<h3>Chrysamere</h3>
<p>The Paladin's Blade is an ancient claymore with offensive capabilities  surpassed only by its own defenses. It lends the wielder health,  protects him or her from fire, and reflects any spells cast against the  wielder back to the caster. Seldom has Chrysamere been wielded by any  bladesman for any length of time, for it chooses not to favor one  champion.</p>
<h3>Staff of Magnus</h3>
<p>The Staff of Magnus, one of the elder artifacts of Tamriel, was a  metaphysical battery of sorts for its creator, Magnus. When used, it  absorbs an enemy's health and mystical energy. In time, the Staff will  abandon the mage who wields it before he becomes too powerful and upsets  the mystical balance it is sworn to protect.</p>
<h3>Warlock's Ring</h3>
<p>The Warlock's Ring of the Archmage Syrabane is one of the most popular  relics of myth and fable. In Tamriel's ancient history, Syrabane saved  all of the continent by judicious use of his Ring, and ever since, it  has helped adventurers with less lofty goals. It is best known for its  ability to reflect spells cast at its wearer and to improve his or her  speed and to restore health. No adventurer can wear the Warlock's Ring  for long, for it is said that the Ring is Syrabane's alone to command.</p>
<h3>Ring of Phynaster</h3>
<p>The Ring of Phynaster was made hundreds of years ago by a man who needed  good defenses to survive his adventurous life. Thanks to the Ring,  Phynaster lived for hundreds of years, and since then it has passed from  person to person. The Ring improves its wearer's overall resistance to  poison, magicka, and shock. Still, Phynaster was cunning and cursed the  ring so that it eventually disappears from its holder's possessions and  returns to another resting place, discontent to stay anywhere but with  Phynaster himself.</p>
<h3>Ring of Khajiit</h3>
<p>The Ring of the Khajiit is an ancient relic, hundreds of years older  than Rajhin, the thief that made the Ring famous. It was Rajhin who used  the Ring's powers to make himself invisible and as quick as the breath  of wind. Using the Ring, he became the most successful burglar in  Elsweyr's history. Rajhin's eventual fate is a mystery, but according to  legend, the Ring rebelled against such constant use and disappeared,  leaving Rajhin helpless before his enemies.</p>
<h3>Mace of Molag Bal</h3>
<p>Also known as the Vampire's Mace, the Mace of Molag Bal drains its  victims of magicka and gives it to the bearer. It also has the ability  to transfer an enemy's strength to its wielder. Molag Bal has been quite  free with his artifact. There are many legends about the Mace. It seems  to be a favorite for vanquishing wizards.</p>
<h3>Masque of Clavicus Vile</h3>
<p>Ever the vain one, Clavicus Vile made a masque suited to his own  personality. The bearer of the Masque is more likely to get a positive  response from the people of Tamriel. The higher his personality, the  larger the bonus. The best known story of the Masque tells the tale of  Avalea, a noblewoman of some renown. As a young girl, she was grossly  disfigured by a spiteful servant. Avalea made a dark deal with Clavicus  Vile and received the Masque in return. Though the Masque did not change  her looks, suddenly she had the respect and admiration of everyone. A  year and a day after her marriage to a well connected baron, Clavicus  Vile reclaimed the Masque. Although pregnant with his child, Avalea was  banished from the Baron's household. Twenty one years and one day later,  Avalea's daughter claimed her vengeance by slaying the Baron.</p>
<h3>Mehrunes Razor</h3>
<p>The Dark Brotherhood has coveted this ebony dagger for generations. This  mythical artifact is capable of slaying any creature instantly. History  does not record any bearers of Mehrune's Razor. However, the Dark  Brotherhood was once decimated by a vicious internal power struggle. It  is suspected that the Razor was involved.</p>
<h3>Cuirass of the Savior's Hide</h3>
<p>Another of Hircine's artifacts was the Cuirass of the Savior's Hide. The  Cuirass has the special ability to resist magicka. Legend has it that  Hircine rewarded his peeled hide to the first and only mortal to have  ever escaped his hunting grounds. This unknown mortal had the hide  tailored into this magical Cuirass for his future adventures. The  Savior's Hide has a tendency to travel from hero to hero as though it  has a mind of its own.</p>
<h3>Spear of Bitter Mercy</h3>
<p>One of the more mysterious artifacts is the Spear of Bitter Mercy.  Little to nothing is known about the Spear. There are no recorded  histories but many believe it to be of Daedric origin. The only known  legend about it is its use by a mighty hero during the fall of the  Battlespire. The hero was aided by the Spear in the defeat of Mehrunes  Dagon and the recapturing of the Battlespire. Since that time, the Spear  of Bitter Mercy has made few appearances within Tamriel.</p>
<h3>Daedric Scourge</h3>
<p>The Daedric Scourge is a mighty mace forged from sacred ebony in the  Fires of Fickledire. The legendary weapon of Mackkan, it was once a  fierce weapon used to send spirits of black back into Oblivion. The  weapon lhas the ability to summon creatures from Oblivion, Once a tool  used against the Daedric Lords in the Battlespire, it now roams the land  with adventurers.</p>
<h3>Bow of Shadows</h3>
<p>Legend has it that the Bow of Shadows was forged by the Daedra  Nocturnal. The legendary ranger, Raerlas Ghile, was granted the Bow for a  secret mission that failed, and the Bow was lost. Raerlas did not go  down without a hearty fight and is said to have, with the aid of the  Bow, taken scores of his foes with him. The Bow grants the user the  ability of invisibility and increased speed. Many sightings of the Bow  of Shadows have been reported, and it is even said that the sinister  Dark Elf assassin of the Second Era, Dram, once wielded this bow.</p>
<h3>Fists of Randagulf</h3>
<p>Randagulf of Clan Begalin goes down in Tamrielic history as one of the  mightiest warriors from Skyrim. He was known for his courage and  ferocity in battle and was a factor in many battles. He finally met his  fate when King Harald conquered Skyrim. King Harald respected this great  hero and took Randagulf's gauntlets for his own. After King Harald  died, the gauntlets disappeared. The King claimed that the Fists granted  the bearer added strength.</p>
<h3>Ice Blade of the Monarch</h3>
<p>The Ice Blade of the Monarch is truly one of Tamriel's most prized  artifacts. Legend has it that the Evil Archmage Almion Celmo enchanted  the claymore of a great warrior with the soul of a Frost Monarch, a  stronger form of the more common Frost Atronach. The warrior, Thurgnarr  Assi, was to play a part in the assassination of a great king in a far  off land, and become the new leader. The assassination failed and the  Archmage was imprisoned. The Ice Blade freezes all who feel its blade.  The Blade circulates from owner to owner, never settling in one place  for long.</p>
<h3>Ring of Surroundings</h3>
<p>Little is known of this prize but it is said that it lends the wearer  the ability to blend in with their surroundings.</p>
<h3>Boots of the Apostle</h3>
<p>The Boots of the Apostle are a true mystery. The wearer of the boots is  rumored to be able to levitate, though nobody has ever seen them used.</p>
<h3>The Mentor's Ring</h3>
<p>This ring is a prized possession for any apprentice to magic. It lends  the wearer the ability to increase their intelligence and wisdom, thus  making their use of magic more efficient. The High Wizard Carni Asron is  said to be the creator of the Ring. It was a construct for his young  apprentices while studying under his guidance. After Asron's death, the  Ring and several other possessions vanished and have been circulated  throughout Tamriel.</p>
<h3>Ring of the Wind</h3>
<p>No facts are known about this Ring, but the title and the few rumors  lend one to think it grants the wearer added speed.</p>
<h3>Vampiric Ring</h3>
<p>One of the more deadly and rare artifacts in Tamriel is the Vampiric  Ring. It is said that the Ring has the power to steal its victim's  health and grant it to the wearer. The exact nature and origin of the  Ring is wholly unknown, but many elders speak of its evil creation in  Morrowind long, long ago by a cult of Vampire followers. The Vampiric  Ring is an extremely rare artifact and is only seen every few hundred  cycles of the moons.</p>
<h3>Eleidon's Ward</h3>
<p>Eleidon was a holy knight of legend in Breton history. He was a sought  after man for his courage and determination to set all wrongs right. In  one story, it is said that he rescued a Baron's daughter from sure death  at the hands of an evil warlord. For his reward, the Baron spent all of  his riches to have an enchanted shield built for Eidelon. The Shield  granted Eleidon the opportunity to heal his wounds.</p>
<h3>Staff of Hasedoki</h3>
<p>Hasedoki was said to have been a very competitive wizard. He wandered  the land in search for a wizard who was greater than he. To the best of  all knowledge, he never found a wizard who could meet up to his  challenge. It is said that he felt so lonely and isolated because so  many feared his power, that he bonded his life-force into his very own  staff, where his soul remains to this very day. Magic users all over  Tamriel have been searching for this magical staff. Granting its wielder  a protection of magicka, it is a sure prize for any magic user.</p>
<h3>Bloodworm Helm</h3>
<p>The King of Worms was said to have left behind one of his prized  possessions, the Bloodworm Helm. The Helm is a construct of magically  formed bone. The Helm allows the user to summon skeletons and control  the undead. It would be a prized artifact to a necromancer.</p>
<h3>Dragonbone Mail</h3>
<p>This cuirass is one of the greatest artifacts any collector or hero  could own. It is constructed of real dragon bone and was enchanted by  the first Imperial Battlemage, Zurin Arctus, in the early years of the  Third Era. It is a truly exquisite piece of work and many have sought to  possess it. The properties of the Cuirass allow the wearer to be resist  fire, and to damage an enemy with a blast of fire. Little is known  about the involvement of Zurin Arctus with the enchantment of the  Cuirass, but an old tale speaks of a debt that he owed to a traveling  warrior. Like the warrior, the Dragonbone Mail never stays put for long.</p>
<h3>Skull Crusher</h3>
<p>The Skull Crusher is an amazingly large, and powerful weapon. The  Warhammer was created in a fire, magically fueled by the Wizard, Dorach  Gusal, and was forged by the great weaponsmith, Hilbongard Rolamus. The  steel is magically hardened and the weight of the weapon is amazingly  light, which makes for more powerful swings and deadly blows. The  Warhammer was to be put on display for a festival, but thieves got it  first. The Skull Crusher still travels Tamriel in search of its  creators.</p>
<h3>Goldbrand</h3>
<p>This magical Sword is almost a complete mystery. Thieves tell tales  about its golden make and how it was actually forged by ancient dragons  of the North. Their tales claim that it was given to a great knight who  was sworn to protect the dragons. The Sword lends its wielder the  ability to do fire damage on an enemy. Goldbrand has not been sighted in  recent history and is said to be awaiting a worthy hero.</p>
<h3>Fang of Haynekhtnamet</h3>
<p>Black Marsh was once known to be inhabited with what the Argonians  called the Wamasus. Northern men considered them to be intelligent  dragons with lightning for blood. One such mighty beast, Haynekhtnamet,  was slain by the Northern men, though it took 7 days and nights, and a  score of men. One of the surviving men took a fang home as a trophy. The  fang was carved down into a blade and fashioned into a small dagger.  The Dagger mysteriously houses some of the beast's magical properties  and grants the user the ability to do shock damage on an opponent. This  unique Dagger is seen occasionally by traveling heroes.</p>
<h3>Umbra Sword</h3>
<p>The Umbra Sword was enchanted by the ancient witch Naenra Waerr, and its  sole purpose was the entrapment of souls. Used in conjunction with a  soul gem, the Sword allows the wielder the opportunity to imprison an  enemy's soul in the gem. Naenra was executed for her evil creation, but  not before she was able to hide the Sword. The Umbra Sword is very  choosy when it comes to owners and therefore remains hidden until a  worthy one is found.</p>
<h3>Denstagmer's Ring</h3>
<p>All that is known of this Ring is that it may grant the user protection  from certain elements. Even the name Denstagmer is a mystery.</p>
<h3>Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw</h3>
<p>One of Valenwood's legendary heroes is Oreyn Bearclaw. Son of King Faume  Toad-Eye, he was a respected clan hunter and a future leader. Wood  Elven legend claims Oreyn single handedly defeated Glenhwyfaunva, the  witch-serpent of the Elven wood, forever bringing peace to his clan.  Oreyn would go on to accomplish numerous other deeds, eventually losing  his life to the Knahaten Flu. His Helm stood as a monument of his  stature for future generations to remember. The Helm was lost  eventually, as the Clan split, and is now a treasured artifact for  adventurers. The Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw is rumored to improve the  wearers agility and endurance.</p>
<h3>Daedric Crescent Blade</h3>
<p>Probably the most rare and even outlawed item of all the great prizes is  the Daedric Crescent Blade. The Blade was used by Mehrunes Dagon's  Daedric forces in the capture of the Imperial Battlespire. These  extremely unique Blades were gathered up and destroyed after the  Battlespire was recaptured by the Empire. All but one it seems. Though  the Empire believes them all to be destroyed, it is rumored that one  still remains in existence, somewhere in Tamriel, though none have ever  seen it. The Blade lends it's weilder the ability to do great damage on  an enemy and allows him to paralyze and put heavy wear on his enemy's  armor. Quite the prize for any mighty warrior, if it does indeed exist.</p>

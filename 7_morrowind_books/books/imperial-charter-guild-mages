The Guild of Mages provides benefits to scholars of magic and  established laws regarding the proper use of magic. The Guild is  dedicated to the collection, preservation, and distribution of magical  knowledge with an emphasis on ensuring that all citizens of Tamriel  benefit from this knowledge.
The Guild of Mages was established on Summerset Isle in the year 230 of  the Second Era by Vanus Galerion and Rilis XII. It was later confirmed  by the "Guilds Act" of Potentate Versidue-Shaie.
Crimes against fellow members of the Guild are treated with the harshest  discipline. Whether a member may regain their status in the Guild is  determined by the Arch-Mage.
The Guild of Mages only accepts candidates of keen intelligence and  dominant will. Candidates must exhibit mastery in the great schools of  magic: Destruction, Alteration, Illusion, and Mysticism. Candidates must  also display practical knowledge of enchantments and alchemical  processes.
Candidates must present themselves to the Steward of the Guild Hall for  examination and approval.

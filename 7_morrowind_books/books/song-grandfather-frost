He he! Ha ho!
To the workshop we will go!
The candy -- so sweet! A yummy winter treat!
Sugar warmed by the pale hearth light
Happiness spreads throughout the night!
He he! Ha ho!
To the workshop we will go!
Grandfather Frost is coming near
To spread his candy and his cheer!
Better than trinkets, better than toys
So say the little girls and boys!
He he! Ha ho!
To the workshop we will go!
Candy, candy -- he makes so much!
Using the Grandfather's magic touch!
So it's back to the workshop in the snow!
With lovely lanterns all aglow!
He he! Ha ho! He he he ha ha ho!

Lucian,
Here's the loot from the jeweler heist. Like my marker? I figured that would get your attention. The grahl make great guards, and I knew you'd be able to slip past them. I've paid off the crew and given the Guild its cut. I'll see you in Cyrodiil at that inn we talked about.
The museum should be an easy haul. Security is light, and there's a broken window in the basement. But we can talk more about that later.

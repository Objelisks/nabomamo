[This is a volume of verse collected from Ashlander wise women. 'May I shrink to dust' is from the Ahemmusa Ashlanders of the Grazelands.]
May I shrink to dust
	In your cold, wild Wastes,
	And may my tongue speak
	Its last hymn to your winds.
I pray for the herder
	That whistles to his guar at play.
	I pray for the hunter
	That stalks the white walkers.
	I pray for the wise one
	That seeks under the hill,
	And the wife who wishes
	For one last touch of her dead child's hand.
I will not pray for that which I've lost
	When my heart springs forth
	From your soil, like a seed,
	And blossoms anew beneath tomorrow's sun.

Foreman Hlevala,
Current activities within the plantation have been highly noted with outstanding performance. The 'nemer' seem to have a fine grasp on our routines since you have given them their "disciplinary schooling". I commend you on your fine efforts and success. You shall be rewarded greatly.
If you will, make sure the following 'nemer' are all accounted for. I will have to have them marked as plantation property for my personal records.

Arabhi
Gah-Julan

Best Regards,

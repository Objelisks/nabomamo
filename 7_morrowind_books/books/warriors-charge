The Warrior's Charge
	An old poem of the Redguards
 
	The star sung far-flung tales
	Wreathed in the silver of Yokuda fair,
	Of a Warrior who, arrayed in hue sails
	His charges through the serpent's snare
And the Lord of runes, so bored so soon,
	Leaves the ship for an evening's dare,
	Perchance to wake, the coiled snake,
	To take its shirt of scales to wear
And the Lady East, who e'ery beast,
	Asleep or a'prowl can rouse a scare,
	Screams as her eye, alight in the sky
	A worm no goodly sight can bear
And the mailed Steed, ajoins the deed
	Not to be undone from his worthy share,
	Rides the night, towards scale bright,
	Leaving the seasoned Warrior's care
	Then the serpent rose, and made stead to close,
	The targets lay plain and there,
	But the Warrior's blade the Snake unmade,
	And the charges wander no more, they swear

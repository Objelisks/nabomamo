Customers,
I am stocking potions for treatment of the Blight as fast as I can get  my orders in from Sadrith Mora. Please keep checking back as I receive  new shipments at random times. In the meantime, I recommend you stay  indoors as much as possible, use common disease resistance potions for  prevention, and treat outbreaks with cure common disease potions.

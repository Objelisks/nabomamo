The most disciplined and effective military force in history, the  Imperial Legions preserve the peace and rule of law in the Empire. At  need, the legion garrisons can be swiftly mobilized to protect against  invasions or internal disorders, but in Vvardenfell District of  Morrowind, the local forts help to insure law and order, providing  guards to supplement the local guard units of the Temple and Great  Houses Hlaalu, Redoran, and Telvanni.
There are five legion garrisons in Vvardenfell District. The three town  garrisons -- Moonmoth Legion Fort in Balmora, Buckmoth Legion Fort in  Ald'ruhn, and Fort Pelagiad in Pelagiad -- are at full complement. The  Hawkmoth Legion garrisoned at Castle Ebonheart is an elite honor guard  unit, and also at full complement. The frontier installation, Fort  Darius in Gnisis village, is currently the only under-strength garrison  on Vvardenfell. Qualified citizens seeking enlistment in the Imperial  Legion should apply to the commander of that garrison, General Darius.
The Legion selects candidates on the basis of superior endurance, the  soldierly virtue, and trustworthy personality, the citizen's virtue, for  service in the Legion is the model for the duties of Imperial  citizenship. Troopers are expected to demonstrate mastery of the long  blade, the spear, and blunt weapons. Legion troops train with shield and  heavy armor, and so must be skilled at blocking and moving in heavy  armor. 
As a trooper or knight, you must master the long blade, spear, and blunt  weapons. You must block whatever blows you can, and take unblocked  blows upon your heavy armor. Recruit must also be proficient at  athletics, both to march long distances with heavy packs, and to advance  and maneuver, charge and retreat on the field of battle.

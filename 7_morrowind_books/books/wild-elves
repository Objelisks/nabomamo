In the wilds of most every province of Tamriel, descended  philosophically if not directly from the original inhabitants of the  land, are the Ayleids, commonly called the Wild Elves.  While three  races of Elven stock -- the Altmer (or High Elves), the Bosmer (or Wood  Elves), and the Dunmer (or Dark Elves) -- have assimilated well into the  new cultures of Tamriel, the Ayleids and their brethren have remained  aloof toward our civilization, preferring to practice the old ways far  from the eyes of the world.
The Wild Elves speak a variation of Old Cyrodilic, opting to shun  Tamrielic and separating themselves from the mainstream of Tamriel even  further than the least urbanized of their Elven cousins.  In temperament  they are dark-spirited and taciturn -- though this is from the point of  view of outsiders (or "Pellani" in their tongue), and doubtless they  act differently within their own tribes.
Indeed, one of the finest sages of the University of Gwilym was a  civilized Ayleid Elf, Tjurhane Fyrre (1E2790-2E227), whose published  work on Wild Elves suggests a lively, vibrant culture.  Fyrre is one of  the very few Ayleids to speak freely on his people and religion, and he  himself said "the nature of the Ayleid tribes is multihued, their  personalities often wildly different from their neighbor[ing] tribes"  (Fyrre, T., Nature of Ayleidic Poesy, p. 8, University of Gwilym Press,  2E12).
Like any alien culture, Wild Elves are often feared by the simple  people of Tamriel.  The Ayleids continue to be one of the greatest  enigmas of the continent of Tamriel.  They seldom appear in the pages of  written history in any role, and then only as a strange sight a  chronicler stumbles upon before they vanish into the wood.  When  probable fiction is filtered from common legend, we are left with almost  nothing.  The mysterious ways of the Ayleids have remained shrouded  since before the First Era, and may well remain so for thousands of  years to come.

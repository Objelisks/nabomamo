[on the cover of the package]
To the Outlander lately proclaiming his identity as the Nerevarine, to  be delivered with haste --

[the note itself]
The assertions made being in direct contradiction of the doctrine of the  Tribunal, namely, that you are the Nerevarine, the reincarnation of the  Sainted Lord Nerevar, are, in addition to being against Temple  teaching, incredible and implausible in the extreme.
The revelations made by the Inquisition, namely, that you yourself are  in fact an agent of the Imperial Intelligence Service, otherwise known  as the Order of Blades, lately made with substantial evidence by the  Lord High Archordinator, Berel Sala, further calls into question the  validity of and motivations behind your claims.
However, as incredible as your claims are, as much as they are in direct  contradiction of the teachings of the Temple, and tainted as they are  by the inferences to be made upon your close association with the covert  policies and interests of the Emperor, the interests of the Temple and  its leadership, and in particular, the interests of His Immortal  Lordship, Vivec, are best served by a close and personal examinations of  the claims being made, and close and personal examinations of the  motivations and character of the claimant.
The Temple, through its examinations of its records, in particular, the  records of the Heirographa and Apographa, is intimately familiar with  the many and varied claims of signs and feats that would mark the  Nerevarine according to prophecy.
Therefore, in the event of the fulfillment of certain of those most  remarkable and scarcely credible claims -- namely, that the claimant  should, at one time, be the acknowledged holder of several ancient  titles of power and authority of the Dunmer people, to whit, Hortator of  the Great Houses and Nerevarine of the Ashlander tribes -- the Temple  proposes that the claimant of the identity of the Nerevarine shall  present himself for inspection before his Reverend Honor, Archcanon Lord  Tholer Saryoni, High Archcanon and Chancellor of Vivec, Archcanon of  the Canonry of Vvardenfell, Arch-Priest of the High Fane, for a review  and consideration of his claims and identity. However, until such time  as the claimant actually has been named Hortator separately and jointly  by the three Great Houses of Vvardenfell, and at the same time has been  named Nerevarine separately and jointly by the four tribes of the  Ashlanders, there is no purpose in reviewing or discussing these claims.
Because of the Temple's official position on the prophecies of the  Nerevarine, and in the interests of preserving the security of the  claimant from those parties who might wish to do him harm, it is  convenient that the claimant of the title Nerevarine shall present  himself in secret to Archcanon Saryoni in the archcanon's private  quarters in the High Fane of Vivec. 
To signify agreement with these terms and conditions for a meeting with  the archcanon, the Nerevarine claimant may present himself to the healer  of the High Fane of Vivec, Danso Indules, and the necessary  arrangements will be made. Once again, no purpose is served by a meeting  until the claimant is named Hortator of the three Great Houses and is  named Nerevarine of the four Ashlander tribes.

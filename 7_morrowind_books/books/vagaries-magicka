[a passage from the text of THE VAGARIES OF MAGICKA]
"...but take care, lest power enfeeble the fundaments, and curtail the  flow through the Congeries, except when functions be warranted. And  safeguard that the Congeries shall not be abused by prideful wizards,  confident in their skill and blinded by their ambitions. In this, hold  the ordering of the Congeries among the oldest and most trusted of  mages, and make secure this ordering through arcane codes and keys to  confound even the most clever students.
"The Restorals must be most carefully guarded, for how often have even  the wise lusted to overreach their bodies and souls with vitality and  mana. And also must the Magica Fountains be damped and banked,  sanctioning their engendering only to the reconsecration of essential  arcane engines and templates, and then only by common assent of the  Council."

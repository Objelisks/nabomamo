[The following are notes prepared by Hasphat Antabolis for Caius  Cosades.]
House Dagoth is an extinct Great House. In the wake of the ancient  Battle of Red Mountain, its leadership was revealed to have plotted  treason, and was discredited. Many of House Dagoth died defending the  House; those survivors who were faithful to the Great Council were  redistributed among the other houses. The Temple says the ancient,  legendary evil beings that dwell beneath Red Mountain in the Dagoth Ur  region are the original leaders of this extinct house, sustained by some  powerful, evil sorceries.
These books include references to the Sixth House and its destruction.  The bookseller Dorisa Darvel over in the Commercial District might have  copies.

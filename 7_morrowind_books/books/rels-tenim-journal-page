We've struck a bargain with evil. While I am uncomfortable and feel some  unease with our current arrangement, I believe these warrens will serve  us well for some time. Those who hope to destroy me must be of stout  spirit and cunning mind, for if they simply forge ahead in these caves,  they may meet a fate far worse than death.
When we first discovered these caves and began our explorations, we were  sure we had found refuge from our enemies. Little did we know, as we  pushed into the interior galleries what we would find. In the final  chamber, we came upon the ruined portal to a vast tomb. At first we were  eager to chance upon some riches to fill our coffers, but instead we  found ourselves within the nest of deadly creatures. By our wits and  skill of arms, we were able to retreat from the dark lair. For a time we  sealed the entry, but the threat continued to gnaw at us. It was Giden  who conceived the plan with which we presented to those beings of  darkness. In return for our right to dwell within these caves, we  provide "sustenance" for these creatures. To assist us in this venture,  we have created a lure, a path for the bounty hunters and meddlesome  folk to follow. The unwary will find themselves in the clutches of a  black fate.
Mulvrulea is very unhappy with the current conditions and I am finding  myself concurring. This cannot come to a good end, but we must stay the  course until a new safehold can be found.

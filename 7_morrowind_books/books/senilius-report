Our excavations have turned up little in these last few days. I have  found nothing new in the ruins. Everything seems as clean and  undisturbed as the day we first opened the outer doors. I know there are  unexplored depths. I can feel massive Dwemer machinery still running  beneath my feet, even as I write this, but I can find no way to get to  it. You must not give up on us for a lack results this soon, Edwinna. I  am sure a great discovery lies somewhere below.
If only the secret of Passwall were not lost nearly a generation ago.  With a few of those precious scrolls, I would be in the lower levels  already where the real discoveries are to be made.
There is some good news. I have also discovered that "Mzuleft" you  were looking for. Apparently "Mzuleft" is the proper name for the large  Dwemer ruins south of Dagon Fel. Be careful not to confuse them with the  ruins of "Nchardahrk" nearby.
The last of the Dwemer centurion spiders in the upper levels was  finally disabled and dismantled for study. I wish we could study them  while they are still active, but that is far too dangerous.
I also heard a strange story about the centurion spider that we  captured and sent back to Cyrodiil. The ship captain I hired wrote to me  with an odd story. He said that the spider nearly broke through its  cage several times while near Vvardenfell, but once he left he Sea of  Ghosts, the centurion suddenly stopped working. What happened next shows  that he had more wits than I gave him credit for. He ordered the ship  turned about and as they approached Vvardenfell again, the centurion  began moving just as suddenly. This is a curious phenomenon and  certainly deserves more investigation.
Your servant,

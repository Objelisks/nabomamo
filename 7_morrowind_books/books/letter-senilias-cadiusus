Dearest Senilias,
The bearer of this note, <Name>, has provided useful service, and shown considerable resourcefulness. I have employed <Name> in retrieving an item from Arkngthand, so you can count on some familiarity with Dwemer ruins. If you have a place, I believe <Name> will give satisfaction.
If you have any luck, perhaps you'll use the bearer to send a note my way.
My best regards and affection to you and Pania,
Hasphat Antabolis

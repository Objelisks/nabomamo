Alas, Morty, my fallen companion, could not make it this far. I regret  that his corpse still holds the key to the tomb I must reach in order to  achieve the mission. I am left alone, with only blade and skill to  accomplish this task. I believe I have come to the end of my journey.  But, without the key, I find myself in the position of forcing entry.  For, behind this door, I am sure an evil terror awaits. 
I leave this warning in case I do not make it. Surely, this door is  trapped, and my lockpicking and disarming ability leaves much to be  desired. If someone happens across my body, know that I have failed, and  know that there is surely a great prize, the Staff of Hasedoki,  awaiting further into this evil tomb. Beware the keeper of the great  staff.

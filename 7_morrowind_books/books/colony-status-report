As the Factor is no doubt aware, the mine has been expanded, yielding an  increase in ore output by 18 percent. Weekly quotas are being met  regularly.
During the last two shipments of supplies, two crates of wickwheat were  noted to be rotten. The matter has been addressed with the supplier, and  a refund should be arriving at the Factor's office sometime within the  next few days.
At this time, there is nothing further to report.
Humbly,
Falco Galenus

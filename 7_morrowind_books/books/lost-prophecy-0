[from the Apographa of the Dissident Priests, annotated by Gilvas  Barelo, Abbot of Holamayan]
From seventh sign of eleventh generation,
Neither Hound nor Guar, nor Seed nor Harrow, 
But Dragon-born and far-star-marked,
Outlander Incarnate beneath Red Mountain,
Blessed Guest counters seven curses,
Star-blessed hand wields thrice-cursed blade,
To reap the harvest of the unmourned house.
Notes
Lines 1-3: 'Of ancient family, but not of the four great Ashlander  clans. Born under foreign stars and the sign of the Dragon -- the  Imperial sign.'
Line 4-5: 'Outlander Incarnate' appears as a formal epithet, stressing  the linkage between the words. The Outlander Incarnate is a 'blessed  guest', one not born of the tribes but accepted as a guest with rights  of hearth and hospitality. Under Red Mountain he will confront and  balance against seven curses. See the 'Seven Curses' prophecy; also,  Dagoth Ur is served by his seven kin, once great wizard-lords, called  'ash vampires' by the Ashlanders.
Line 6-7: 'Star-blessed' suggests Azura, the Daedra Lord and patron of  magic, fate, and prophecy. 'Thrice-cursed blade' may refer to  a weapon  called Keening, associated in certain legends with the Battle of Red  Mountain and Dwemer craftlord Kagrenac. 'Reap the harvest' is a  reference to the proverb, "You harvest from the seeds you plant," which  means you get what your labors deserve, in both a positive sense of  reward and negative sense of punishment. The 'unmourned house' could be  either or both of the lost Great Houses of the Dunmer -- House Dwemer  and House Dagoth.

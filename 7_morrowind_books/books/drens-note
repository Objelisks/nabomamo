Ranes and Navil,
You have served me well over the years. My brother has been trying to  stop our business. We've lost over half our shipments recently. The Duke  may be my brother, but if he keeps interfering I am afraid he must be  killed. I will be next in line and can consolidate my power before the  Redorans even come up with a candidate. I am telling you this so that  you know the risks you may be taking. If you are unwilling, I will  accept your word of honor not to speak of our business. If you stay, I  will reward you.
D

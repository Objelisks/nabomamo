[From a short Temple pamphlet for Western readers.]
Ages ago, Nerevar was the greatest Dunmer general, First Councilor, and  companion of Vivec, Almalexia, and Sotha Sil, who, with the power of the  great Ring of the Ancestors, One-Clan-Under-Moon-and-Star, united the  Dunmer Houses to confront the evil Dwemer, the treacherous House Dagoth,  and their Western allies at Red Mountain.
By Providence, the faithless Dwemer were utterly destroyed, and their  allies defeated, but Nerevar, mortally wounded in combat with the  traitor Dagoth Ur, was driven from Red Mountain. Nerevar died not long  after of his wounds, but he lived to see the birth of the Temple, and to  bless the unity of the Dunmer into the safekeeping of Almsivi, the  Temple, and all its communion of saints.

"Shamed by my corruption, and despairing of my own welfare, I passively  acquiesced in my gradual integration into the affairs of Clan Aundae. I  made no human my prey, only beasts, and kept myself apart from the other  clankin; nonetheless, I abandoned hope and lived like a beast.

It is there that, by chance,  I made petition to the Lord of Troubles, Molag Bal, at an altar deep in  the caverns beneath the pilgrim's shrine. I was surprised, and  thrilled, and terrified, when Molag Bal, or some aspect or agent of that  Daedra Lord, offered me a chance to cure myself of vampirism, in return  for a favor.

I awoke before the altar, and gazed in the reflection  of my own sword blade at my own face - no longer a blood-seeking beast  of teeth and empty eyes."

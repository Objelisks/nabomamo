It's been many days since the collapse. I have had many good and  exciting adventures. I fear this is the last. I am still unsure what  happened. Was it a trap that caused the collapse? I didn't hear the  click of any device. Perhaps it was simply a freak accident, and I was  simply in the wrong place at the right time. Regardless, I now lie here,  half buried in the collapse, with crushed legs. The pain was unbearable  for the first day or so. Or was it? Who knows? You lose track of time  in a place like this. Especially in a situation such as this. The pain  has all but left though. Getting used to pain is a battle all in itself.  My time now runs short. I will die here, in this tomb. No better place  for a dead man.
My adventures have taken me all over. I have been places that man never  knew existed. I have retrieved artifacts and fine treasures that were  thought to be myth. From chalices of origins long lost, to gems with  power unthought of by man, to powerful religious artifacts that house  more interest to madmen than sane. I shall at least take these fine  memories with me to the grave.
I shall miss my father. Like me, he was also a man of adventure. I  followed in his footsteps, though I was blessed with far more luck than  he. Until now, of course. He shall be on his own now. At least I am  spared any more jokes about my childhood pet. And my students...how I  treasured teaching them the secrets and alien concepts of all things  unknown and mysterious. May they be successful.
I do not go down along though. With my crippled body, in this heap of  earth, I am accompanied by my trusty leather, my steel, and most of all,  my token hat. Unable to reach them under the mass, I know they are  untouchable and safe. I will not die alone.
Farewell,
Indie

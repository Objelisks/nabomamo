The Guild of Fighters provides employment to free-swords and mercenaries  and contracts to local citizens. Citizens may contract with the Guild  for the removal of creatures and pests, the delivery of goods on  dangerous routes, the collection of beasts for the arenas, and other  duties defined by the Guild Stewards.
The Guild of Fighters was established under the section 4 of the "Guilds  Act," and this charter was first confirmed under the Potentate  Versidue-Shaie in the 321st year of the Second Era.
Any member of the Guild of Fighters who strikes or steals from another  member shall be expelled from the Guild. Re-admittance is at the  discretion of the Guild Stewards.
Citizens who contract with the Guild of Fighters and have a dispute may  appeal first to the Guild Steward who accepted the contract and second  with the authorities of each Province.
The Guild selects candidates who are strong and healthy. A candidate  must have some proficiency with long blades, axes, blunt weapons, and  shields. Guildsmen must be able to use and maintain heavy armor.
Candidates must present themselves to the Steward of the Guild Hall for  examination and approval.

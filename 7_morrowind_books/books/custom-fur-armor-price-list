You call yourself a hunter, now prove it. Hiding in the wilds of  Solstheim are the elusive white snow bears and snow wolves. It is said  their fur can protect against the most frigid cold. Kill these beasts,  claim their pelts, and you could be the proud owner of...


Imagine beautiful light white fur armor, made from the pelts of  Solstheim's mysterious snow wolves and snow bears. Never before have I  forged such armor, because nobody has been skilled enough to bring down  the beasts. Could you be the first?

Hear me, children. Once I was a lowly man such as yourselves. By my will  I entered the ranks of the gods. By your unquestioning devotion, you  can share my glory.
Most Necromancers are fools and weaklings. Fodder for the witchhunters.  But you, my servants, you are among the chosen. In the days to come, few  will dare to stand against your might. But one obstacle remains. His  name is Arkay.
He was also a man who entered the ranks of the gods. The similarities  between his mortal life and my own astonish even me. It is only proper  that we should be enemies.
Arkay's Blessing prevents the souls of men, beastmen, and elves from  being used without consent. Arkay's Law prevents those buried with the  proper rituals from being raised to serve my children's will. As you  know, my children, Arkay's Blessing is flexible to those with daring,  but Arkay's Law is unwavering.
To the Scholars: Humiliate the priests of Arkay. Reveal the primitive  burial customs to be mere superstition. Befriend kings with honeyed  words and bind them to your will. Look to my children in Cyrodiil for  guidance.
To the Priests: Use your servants sparingly, let none be seen by the  living. Let the memories of the undead waste away from the people. Send  missionaries to the unbound dead, to the Vampires and the Liches. Let  all the nations of dead carry my banner and my banner alone.
To the Hidden: Wait, as always, in the darkness.
For soon we shall strike. The Temples of Arkay will be torn stone from  stone. The blood of his priests will sate our thirst; their bones will  rise as our servants. The name Arkay will be stuck from the records.  Only I shall hold sway over life and death. Only one name shall be  whispered in fear. The name of your lord and master.

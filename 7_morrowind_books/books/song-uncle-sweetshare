He he! Ha ho!
To the workshop he will go!
My Uncle's candy is so sweet! It's such a yummy winter's treat!
When the sugar is warmed by the pale hearth light
The happiness spreads throughout the night!
He he! Ha ho!
To the workshop he will go!
Uncle Sweetshare is coming near
To spread his candy and his cheer!
It's better than trinkets, games or toys
So say all the little girls and boys!
He he! Ha ho!
To the workshop he will go!
Candy, candy -- he makes so much!
Uncle Sweetshare has a magic touch!
So it's back to the workshop in the snow!
With lovely lanterns all aglow!
He he! Ha ho! He he he ha ha ho!

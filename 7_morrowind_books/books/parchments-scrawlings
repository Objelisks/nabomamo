ALL CRIES ARE WAKING!
Whitest White of all White!
Blackest Blacks of all Blacks!
Shame and Son, Sun, and Shadow!
Stronger than gods, brighter than mortals!
Only He is Awake!
Only He is Alive!
He Knows the Names and the Naming!
He Knows the Wait and the Waiting!
He Enters into every Star and Moon!
He Shines through their Shadows!
One Shape, One Spelling!
One Wraith, One Casting!
From Darkness, He is Armed!
From Light, He is Warded!
He is All Things!
Drake! Liche! Theomen!
On rivers of fire he comes forth!
Through storms of dreams he rides!
With slivers of steel he pierces the Heart!
All Spells, Powers, Curses Broken!
The Chains are Shattered!
The Scales Fall Away!
I see you with MY EYE!
And all is SILENCE!
I Wake! I Remember!
LORD!

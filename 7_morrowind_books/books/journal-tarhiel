I believe I may have found the correct formula for the spell I am  developing. With it, I will be able to travel great distances without  the need to pay others for the service.
If all goes well, I will test out the new spell tomorrow. I believe I  have worked out all of the possible complications. It will allow me to  leap great distances, covering many hundreds of miles. Never before has  one been able to travel in this manner: vaulting from the ground,  sailing through the sky, all without that terrible disorientation of a  spell of flying.
The time is almost upon me. My research is finished, and all of my  calculations are checked and rechecked. They laughed at me when I  suggested this. We'll see who laughs after I leap to the top of their  towers and scream out my success.

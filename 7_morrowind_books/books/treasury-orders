Dearest Tenisi,
Your assistance has been profitable to us both, in many ways. I have but one more favor to ask. Find the land deeds for the Ascadian Isles. Replace the documents owned by Rovone Arvel with those of your own clever design.
Soon we will have enough to leave Vvardenfell together. Until then, you know what must me done, know also that you have my love.
Odral Helvi

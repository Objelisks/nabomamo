Swift and agile are the Morag Tong. Silent and unseen they move.  Illusions they supply to misdirect their prey. Close and sure they  strike with shortblade, or distant and secure they strike from afar with  accurate missile fire. Light armor protects them from harm, and the  acrobatic discipline finds for them the unseen and unlooked-for path.  Have you these virtues? Then, perhaps, your oath and service may please  the Morag Tong.
Do you have your friends and your finery, but no place to go? Do you  laugh and cry, but no longer feel? Do you wear these masks? Then,  perhaps, your oath and service may please the Black Glove.
The blood of the hunter and the blood of the hunted. The joy of the  hidden and the joy of the seeker. The blood of the eye and the blood of  the gate. The joy of the living and the joy of the dead. Are you one  with these things? Then, perhaps, your oath and service may please  Mephala.
To make your oath and enter our service, the worthy must seek the  Grandmaster, who by tradition lives in the unseen and unlooked-for  corners of Vivec City between the blood of battle and the waters of  life.

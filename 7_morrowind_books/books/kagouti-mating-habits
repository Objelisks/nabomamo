Observations made on wild kagouti in southeastern Morrowind.
Kagouti do not seem to travel in large packs, as previously believed.  Perhaps they group into larger packs when mating season is imminent.
Females seem to be dominant sex. Males will bring gifts of food in  exchange for mating advantage. Males sometimes attacked.
Loud vocalizations heard exchanged (believed to be from males),  especially at night. Fascinating.
Males do not seem to engage in physical confrontation for reproductive  rights. Some posturing, but no conflict.
All kagouti display increased aggressiveness during mating. Must be  careful not to be seen.
Mating kagouti found to be increasingly territorial.

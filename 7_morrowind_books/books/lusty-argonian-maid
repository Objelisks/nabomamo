Act IV, Scene III, continued

	Lifts-Her-Tail
	Certainly not, kind sir! I am here but to clean your chambers.
Crantius Colto
	Is that all you have come here for, little one? My chambers?
Lifts-Her-Tail
	I have no idea what it is you imply, master. I am but a poor Argonian maid.
Crantius Colto
	So you are, my dumpling. And a good one at that. Such strong legs and shapely tail.
Lifts-Her-Tail
	You embarrass me, sir!
Crantius Colto
	Fear not. You are safe here with me.
Lifts-Her-Tail
	I must finish my cleaning, sir. The mistress will have my head if I do not!
Crantius Colto
	Cleaning, eh? I have something for you. Here, polish my spear.
Lifts-Her-Tail
	But it is huge! It could take me all night!
Crantius Colto
	Plenty of time, my sweet. Plenty of time.

	ACT VII, SCENE II, CONTINUED
Lifts-Her-Tail
	My goodness, that's quite a loaf! But how ever shall it fit my oven?
Crantius Colto
	This loaf isn't ready for baking, my sweet. It has yet to rise.
Lifts-Her-Tail
	If only we could hurry that along. How would I accomplish such a task?
Crantius Colto
	Oh, my foolish little Argonian maid, you must use your hands.
Lifts-Her-Tail
	You wish me to kneed the loaf? Here?
Crantius Colto
	Of course.
Lifts-Her-Tail
	But what if the mistress catches me? Your loaf was meant to satisfy her appetite.
Crantius Colto
	Don't fret, my delicate flower. I'll satisfy the mistress's cravings later.
Lifts-Her-Tail
	Very well, but I'm afraid my oven isn't hot enough. It could take hours!
Crantius Colto
	Plenty of time, my sweet. Plenty of time.

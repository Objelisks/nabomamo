Blessed are the Bonemen, for they serve without self in spirit  forever. 
Blessed are the Mistmen, for they blend in the glory of the transcendent  spirit. 
Blessed are the Wrathmen, for they render their rage unto the ages. 
Blessed are the Masters, for they bridge the past and span the future.
The Boneman's Oath
We die. 
We pray. 
To live. 
We serve.
The Master's Voice
You swore. 
To Serve. 
Your Lord.

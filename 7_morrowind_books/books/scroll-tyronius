Brother,
I fear by the time you get this writing, I will have been accepted into  the hands of death. I am glad you are not here for the onslaught. We are  outnumbered, five undead to a man. I don't know how they got in! We  swept the halls of this house of the dead, then we locked up. We were  alone. Just myself, Pegasai, Jonis, and Luven. As soon as we saw the  first wave, it appeared from behind! I have no idea how they were able  to surprise us. It's as if they were appearing out of nowhere. Summoned  to this position somehow. We fought long and hard, until we could barely  hold our weapons up anymore. Jonis was the first one to get cut down.  Brother, our longtime friend Jonis, died in front of me in the most  horrible way. But do know, he died with the honor of a fighting man.  This battle will not be won. Pegasai urged me deeper into the tomb. I  saw not Luven, but heard his dying scream come from somewhere within the  tomb. I am taking refuge in this main burial chamber. I am here with  our due payment from Goris. He will not get it from my living hands. I  will hold up until Pegasai comes for me, or until those cursed  bonewalkers come to finish me off.
We committed ourselves to aiding Goris in a task, putting our butts on  the line, and he promised payment. I'll be damned if he is going to take  it back! Brother, if you make it here and find nothing more than my  corpse, I hope you can make some sense out of my final letter to you.  Avenge your Brother, and your trusting colleagues so that our souls may  lay in peace. Goris can be found in a tomb in Tel Mora. We loot and  hideout in the occasional tomb, but that sick fool lives in a tomb with  his deader companions. Without his knowledge, I forged a key that fits  his tomb entry. Use it to gain entry to his lair. Goris should not, and  cannot, get the last action. He betrayed us and used us. Avenge my  Brother. Avenge!
Live long and may you always be in good health,

Tyronius
